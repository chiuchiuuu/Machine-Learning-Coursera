    "\n",
    "**We can speed up gradient descent by having each of our input values in roughly the same range.** This is because $\\theta$ will descend quickly on small ranges and slowly on large ranges, and so will oscillate inefficiently down to the optimum when the variables are very uneven.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to prevent this is to modify the ranges of our input variables so that they are all roughly the same. Ideally $−1 ≤ x_{(i)} ≤ 1 $ or $−0.5 ≤ x_{(i)} ≤ 0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren't exact requirements; we are only trying to speed things up. **The goal is to get all input variables into roughly one of these ranges, give or take a few.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two techniques to help with this are **feature scaling** and **mean normalization**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature scaling**: <u>dividing the input values by the range</u> of the input variable, resulting $−1 ≤ x_i ≤ 1 $. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean normalization**: <u>subtracting the average value</u> for an input variable from the values for that input variable resulting $E(x_i)=0$ \n",

    "Make a plot with *number of iterations* on the x-axis. Now plot the cost function, $J(θ)$ over the number of iterations of gradient descent. If $J(θ)$ ever increases, then you probably need to decrease $\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automatic convergence test\n",
    "\n",
    "Declare convergence if $J(θ)$ decreases by less than $\\varepsilon$ in one iteration, where $\\varepsilon$ is some small value such as $10^{−3}$. However in practice it's difficult to choose this threshold value.\n",

    "### Features and Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "We can improve our features and the form of our hypothesis function in a couple different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We can combine multiple features into one.** For example, we can combine $x_1$ and $x_2$ into a new feature $x_3$ by taking $x_1\\cdot x_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypothesis function need not be linear (a straight line) if that does not fit the data well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can **change the behavior or curve** of our hypothesis function by making it a quadratic, cubic or square root function (or any other form).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our hypothesis function is $h_\\theta(x)=\\theta_0+\\theta_1 x_1$ then we can create additional features based on $x_1$, to get the quadratic function $h_\\theta(x)=\\theta_0+\\theta_1x_1+\\theta_2x^2_1$ or the cubic function $h_\\theta(x)=\\theta_0+\\theta_1x_1+\\theta_2x^2_1+\\theta_3x^3_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cubic version, we have created new features $x_2$ and $x_3$ where $x_2=x^2_1$ and $x_3=x^3_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it a square root function, we could do: $h_\\theta(x)=\\theta_0+\\theta_1x_1+\\theta_2 \\sqrt {x_1} $\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to keep in mind is, if you choose your features this way then feature scaling becomes very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "> e.g. if $x_1$ has range 1 - 1000 then range of $x^2_1$ becomes 1 - 1000000 and that of $x^3_1$ becomes 1 - 1000000000\n",
